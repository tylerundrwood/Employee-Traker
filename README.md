# Employee-Traker

## Description

- I wanted a way for companies to easily create new positions or roles within their company to speed up the hiring process.
- I built this because I was tired of waiting so long for employers to "find" new positions. now they can create one at the tip of their finger tips.
-I learned how to run SQL.
